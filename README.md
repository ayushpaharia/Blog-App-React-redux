## Introduction

This project is made by using React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Axios and jsonplaceholder API. I utilized the lodash library to memoize the data retrival and used thunk as a middleware to make asyc calls with action creators. I used Semantic Ui to style the project.

The frontend is deployed using netlify

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for client side to start the development server
